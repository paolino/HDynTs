# HDynTs

The long term aim for this library is to explore dynamic trees algorythms using haskell and functional programming, possibly achieving the sublinear results of the pointer based ones.

The library comes with a toy console application *hdynts* to explore the tree forest. Feel free to use it as an example to interface to the library.

A recent haskell installation is necessary.

Compilation is achieved via cabal.

~~~~
cabal install
cabal test
cabal haddock --hyperlink-source
~~~~

Then you should find the *hdynts* executable in ```~/.cabal/bin/hdynts```d
